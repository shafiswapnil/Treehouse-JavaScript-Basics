# JavaScript Function

JavaScript is sometimes called a functional programming language.

And yes, be spontaneous while using function. Use function to create reusable code. For example, if you want to print a today's date in your page, you'll simply create a function for that. But don't make the function limited for only one work. Make it *to the point* function. Meaning, If you want the date to be appear in another section of a page, then rather doing the same code again, use the previous made function to do it.

## Function names

 - Can only be made up of letters, numbers, the _, and $ characters
 - They can't start with a number
 - They can't include any spaces or other punctuation

Syntax of a function

```
function name() {
	// it's called a code block inside braces
}
name();
```

# Function Statement

This type of function is called an *anonymous* function. These function doesn't have any names.

```
var name = function() {
	// code block
}
name();
```
