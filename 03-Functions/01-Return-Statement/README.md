# Return Statement

There are couple things to remember when using script return statement. A return statement causes the JavaScript interpreter to **exit** the function immediately. In other words, the return statement should be the last thing on the function.

A return statement can only return a single value. That is
 - string
 - number
 - a boolean value
 - or the contents of the variable
