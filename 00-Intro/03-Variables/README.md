# JavaScript Variables

There are some rules for naming variables:

 - Variable name can't start with a number.
 - Variable name has to be meaningful. Use descriptive names. For example, rather `var s = 0;` do, `var score = 0;`
 - To make variable understandable, use separations. I didn't mean adding space by the way. I meant use underscore, or use camelCasing. Like, `var price_per_unit;` or `var pricePerUnit;`
 - Variable names should contain **Letters, Numbers, Dollar sign, and Underscore** characters.
