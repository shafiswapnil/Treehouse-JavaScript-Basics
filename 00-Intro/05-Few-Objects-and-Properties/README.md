# Little acknowledgement on Objects and Proerties

You know, we use string. Actually string is an object. You can access it's properties as well. For example, if you want to know the length of a string, then you can use `variable.length`.

Here variable is an **Object** and **length** is a command/property. In the middle, the dot(.) is a connection between them.
