# JS Parsing Commands

Few acknowledgments:

 - **Note** ***Nan*** means, Not a Number. ***Nan*** either says that `parseInt()` or `parseFloat()` didn't find a number or it didn't find find a number at the beginning of the variable.
 - Be careful when playing with number in a string!!!!
 - One thing to aware of is, `parseInt()` doesn't returns the numbers after .(dot). For example, if I want to convert **'2.99' (string)** in integer using `parseInt()` It will return just **2**.
