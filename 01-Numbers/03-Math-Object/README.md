# JavaScirpt is made up of objects

 - Numbers are one type of objects
 - Strings are another type of objects

Obejcts have properties. A property is just like a variable that's associated with an object. A String object for example, has a property named **length**. The lenght property holds a numeric value. The number of characters in the string. Each string has it's own length property. Because different strings can have different numbers of characters.

Obejcts also have actions that they can perform. We call this actions **Methods**. The strings for example, have **toUpperCase()** *method*, which takes the string and returns another string with all uppercase letters.

Strings are one type of object in javascript. There are many others. For now, let's see into Math Object.


## Math Object

The math object is use to perform complex mathematical functions. like, finding the square root of a number. Or working with trigonomitric functions like tangent, sin and cosine to create more realistic games and animations.

See Math Object in [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math).
